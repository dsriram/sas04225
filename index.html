<a name="welcome-to-sas04225" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-sas04225"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to SAS04225</h3>

<p>This is an android app and its server backend, which we have developed as a proof of concept for our undergraduate thesis. You can checkout the repository and load the each folder as Netbeans or Eclipse projects.</p>

<h3>
<a name="what-the-framework-does" class="anchor" href="#what-the-framework-does"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What the framework does</h3>

<p>The project is on providing a real-time object recognition framework, which is scalable to many server nodes. It combines indoor localization and novel object recognition features to identify an object which is spatially localized, through a mobile camera with connectivity to the backend server. It uses the OpenCV API to perform the backend operations and uses mDNS for service discovery.</p>

<h3>
<a name="what-is-it-all-about" class="anchor" href="#what-is-it-all-about"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is it all about?</h3>

<p>Consider a scenario where you are in a retail store and have a mobile app which assists you in choosing your product. You point your mobile camera to the product, and immediately you are provided with its price information, nutritional values, and the offers which are available related to it. You add the product to your cart and with a click of a button, add the item to your bill. The you want to buy another product, and you don't know where it is located inside the store. You search for that product in the app, and like your Google Maps, the app guides you down the aisles to the rack, where the product is located.
When you check-out, you just place your mobile on the counter. Your mobile will prepare the bill for the items you have added to the cart and you just need to the amount on the bill and come out with your stuffs, in a breeze. No need for waiting in long queues, no need for those difficult head-breaking search across the aisles of the store to find your product. And you are informed of all the offers currently provided by store. What more? You just get your purchases done in a jiffy, and you get all the goodies too!</p>

<h3>
<a name="what-is-special-about-this-app" class="anchor" href="#what-is-special-about-this-app"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is special about this app?</h3>

<p>Our app tries to reduce the battery usage of the mobile, by offloading all the recognition and user localization tasks to the backend server. So, our app can perform well even on an entry level budget phone with negligible lag in the UI.</p>
